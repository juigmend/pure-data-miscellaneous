===================================================================

“Audiofile Rating” is a software to rate audio stimuli with a graphical 
user interface.

Once opened, the steps displayed in the user interface should be 
followed. It should be intuitive to use.
Details about usage are given below.
 
Audiofile Rating is copyrighted, free to use and free to distribute under

Usage
------

The playlist is an unformatted text file that contains the names of 
the audiofiles to be played, in the order to be played, each in one 
line. The audiofiles should be formatted as “wav”. Audiofile Rating
will not play mp3 or aiff files, for example.

The playlist and the wav files should be in the same directory or folder 
than the Audiofile_Rating .app or .pd file.

After a participant has finished rating all the audiofiles, a file
will be produced with the number of the participant as it was input in
the main window. The name of this file should look like this: 
p1.txt for participant 1; p2.txt for participant 2, etc.
The participants’ responses files will be saved in the same directory 
or folder where the playlist is.

Mind that if in the main window a participant number that already has 
been saved is input, then the current file bearing that number will be 
overwritten without warning and the older file will be lost forever.
To avoid losing data is better to manually backup the produced files 
in a different directory or folder after each data collection session.

Also mind that the path (the full name of the directory or directory 
and enclosing directories or folders) where the files are, should not
contain spaces.

The rest should be evident.
