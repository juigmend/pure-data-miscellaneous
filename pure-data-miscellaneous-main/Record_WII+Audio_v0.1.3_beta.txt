September 5, 2015

===================================================================


Record_Wii+Audio records wiimote accelerometer and audio. It uses the same programming style as in Visuaural. 

Currently supports one of five possible vectors from accelerometer: x, y, z, roll and pitch. 

Dependencies: Pure Data, an OSC data stream (e.g. Darwiinremote sending data from Wiimote)

Record_Wii+Audio is a by-product of my doctoral dissertation currently titled "Mimetical Relationships between Musical Structure and Bodily Mocvement: Measurement and Application", at the University of Jy�skyl� in Finland.

Previous version did not work properly. This one seems to be OK.
However, the user should be aware that if after a recording the participant/dataset number is not changed, the next recording will be overwritten without warning.
