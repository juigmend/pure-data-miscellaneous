Visuaural v0.1.4 Beta

Tested with:
- Puredata Extended 0.42.5
- Macintosh OS 10.11.6
- Quicktime Player 10.4

February, 2017

===================================================================

Visuaural is a software to perform several procedures for
experimental research in music psychology and related fields.
It runs on Puredata Extended.

Once opened, the steps displayed in the user interface should be 
followed.

Visuaural will perform a procedure as stated in a "program", which
should be written in a plain text file. The commands and usage to 
build a Visuaural program appear below.

Visuaural is a by-product of my master’s and doctoral degrees’ research at the 
University of Jyväskylä. 

Visuaural v0.1.4 is copyrighted, free to use and free to distribute under
the GNU General Purpose License version 2.

Program Commands
----------------

prog_ready [name];
	Sets the program to be ready to start. 
	Displays name, date and participant number.

a_repinst [audiofilename.wav];
	Plays back a wav audio file. 
	Waits 5 seconds for wiimote button A or space bar to playback the file again.

a_inst_nxt [audiofilename.wav];
	Plays back a wav audio file.
	Waits wiimote button A or space bar to advance to next step.

a_simpleplay [audiofilename.wav];
	Plays back a wav audio file.
	Waits 3 seconds to advance to next step.

a_randomplay [list.txt];
	Plays back a wav audio file randomly chosen from a list containing audio files names (with extensions). The same list can be used several times and a_randomplay will play the files in the list without repeating unless all the files have been played. If another list is used in between, then the shuffle property will be reset (i.e. a file previously played might be played again)
	After each play it will output a .rpl text file containing the name of the audio file played.
	Waits 3 seconds to advance to next step.

a_restartopt [audiofilename.wav];
	Plays back a wav audio file.
	Waits 5 seconds for wiimote button A or space bar to restart the program.

a_datacap_rt_nom [audiofilename.wav];
	Plays back a wav audio file.
	Records nominal response (100 or 0, wiimote button A or space bar) as the audio file plays.
	Waits 3 seconds to advance to the next step.

v_datacap_rt_nom_GEM [audiofilename.wav videofilename.mov];
	Plays back a wav audio file and a mov video file simultaneously.
	Records nominal response (100 or 0, wiimote button A or space bar) as the audio and video files play.
	Waits 3 seconds to advance to next step.
	This command uses the GEM video machine. Some video formats might not play smoothly.

av_datacap_marker_QT [parameter];
	Plays back a video file and records the time when wiimote button A or space bar is depressed as the video plays. The output is an unformatted text file.
	This command uses Quicktime Player and Applescript, therefore will only work in a computer running Mac OS. After the command is executed it waits 3 seconds to advance to the next step. Quicktime Player has to be first activated (see parameters below). Then any number of files can be opened and played. Quicktime Player can be deactivated afterwards. It will be automatically deactivated when the VA program ends or when “click to restart from (3)” is depressed.
	This command might not work properly if there is a firewall running on the computer. Also Visuaural’s audio level setting will not affect the movie’s audio level.
	
	Parameters:

	1
	Activates Quicktime Player.

	[mediafilename.xxx]
	Media (audio, video or audio with video) file name. 
	The extension depends on the codecs installed. 
	Plays back the file and records time in seconds,
	when the wiimote A button or keyboard spacebar are depressed. 
	Outputs a plain text file with extension .mrk
	Waits 3 seconds to advance to the next step.

	0
	De-activates Quicktime Player.

a_datacap_rt_wii_y [audiofilename.wav];
	Plays back a wav audio file.
	Records continuous response (-100 to 100 at 10Hz, wiimote pitch) as the audio file plays.
	Waits 3 seconds to advance to next step.

a_rec_qstn [audiofilename.wav];
	Plays back a wav audio file.
	Records audio to a .wav file.
	Waits for wiimote button A or space bar to advance to next step.

a_datacap_qstn [audiofilename.wav];
	Plays back a wav audio file.
	Records one of the preset wiimote button or keyboard keys and advances to next step.
	Outputs a plain text file with extension .qst

v_disptxt [parameter];
	Displays text on a black background full screen without mouse cursor.

	Parameters:

	on
	Displays a black full screen.

	off
	Close the black full screen.
